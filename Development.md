# Development Introduction #

The RosaryDS was developed using [PALib](http://www.palib.info) in Microsoft C++ Visual Studio 2008 Express.


## Details ##

  * I don't have this project on a schedule like some of my other projects but if you are interested in developing this project further, please let me know.
  * I ran into some challenges with getting more sound files in RosaryDS because of a 4mb memory issue. It can possibly be avoided with using FAT, however I wanted to keep things to a simple end user experience with one file.
  * I have some C++ 2008 Express PALib application wizards I plan on uploading later.
